renderer
	- stores position of ant into buffer
		- this val is gradually decreased following the same rate
		as the particles which disappear from the grid

OnjectManager? <= NO	

player
	- places down food
	- places down ants



grid
	- stores pheromones
	- stores quick ant refs
	- food
	- walls

visual info
	- ants			- white
	- pheromones	- green/red
	- food			- light green
	- walls			- lighter grey
	- nest			- multiple points
	- background	- black/dark grey
	=> renderer must handle colors too

Flow of information:
	- renderer
		- call func and pass info through that func
			- THIS ONE.
		- renderer has info on initalisation and renderers it
		





Neural netork
	- Remember, you can add inputs into the neural network to
	affect its behaviour
		- You can calculate some stuff for them to promote behaviours
		they exhibits at certain situations.



To make food collision more efficient:
	- Check if
	- more work!

	On initlisation / localenvironment changes
	- each food checks if it's any of its neighbours are not food  
		- if food disappears update surrounding blocks if they're food. Cus they're next
	- WILL NOT WORK IF FOOD HAS MORE SURFACE AREA THAN NUMBER OF ANTS!
		- Thus I will jst go the easy route and have each ant check if they're touching food

Alternative
	- Each ant checks if touching food

Alternative
	- Each cell in current frame gets pushed to array. This arrary

	MAKE SURE ANTS DON'T DUPLICATE FOOD!





`ObjectManager` is more like something that handles the entities/objects of the game.



## Implementing neighbouring front cell selection
`
[
 0 1 2
 3 x 4
 5 6 7
]


0 is [-1,-1] => [-1,0], [0,-1]
2 is [1,-1] => [1,0], [0,1] => set one side to 0 then set the other side to 0

1 is [0,-1] => [-1,-1], [1,-1] => which ever one is 0 is changed to -1 and +1
3 is [-1,0] => [-1,-1], [-1,1] =>

## Planing on how to make ant choose which action based on the three pheromones in front of it and how to
make it efficient





- high concentration of pheromones decrease wandering
	- Math.random < 10/(10+total pheromones)
		- wander
	- else don't follow a trail

science paper foraging: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4060675/




If has 0 pheromones front three blocks (-1 && -1 && -1)
	=> just wander randomly
If not wandering:
	If 1 pheromone path infront 
		- go down that path <= BUT HOW TO IMPLEMENTN (is it right turn, left turn, or just keep moving?)
	if 2
		- randomly pick one with high probability of choosing the the highest contributor
	if 3
		- randomly pick one with higher probability of choosing the highest contributor

const ran = Math.random()*totalPheromones
ran<[0]
ran>[2]
else:[1]

testing:
[0] = 1
[1] = 1
[2] = 1

ran = 0.3*3
=> 0.9
[0]

ran = 0.6*3
=> 1.8
=> [1]








## Interesting
- created iris by forgetting a this.pStrength >0 condition









## How to test my code:
- make straight line
- make one ant point to it
- run code in debugger step through code and make sure ant goes through expected paths






## Fix to ant not following line problem:
- when a pheromone block exists to the left or right record position
	- If next position is further away from the block you should be turning towards TURN OPPOSITE by x2 amount
- What even causes this problem in the first place?
	- You're trying to merge with the lane	
		- But you turn away too much
			- Essentially (assuming straight line), ants should only correct themselves enough to merge with line
				- How can I calculate this threshold?

- BY STAYING ON THE LINE, THE ANTS SHOULD GRADUALLY ADJUST IT'S INTERNAL DIRECTION TO MATCH THE DIRECTION OF THE LINE	(note that this only applies to straight lines - which is what the line(s) will converge to)
	- Use math.random() to get small and large angle changes! :D
	- This angle changing should only happen when the ants fall off the path

- Can do two checks per tick or one, which one?

-- AIM, make sure they don't turn AWAY from a STRAIGHT LINE
